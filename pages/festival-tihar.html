				<h1 style="margin-top: 30px;" class="text-center underline-meaning">Dashain</h2>
				<p class="margin-30" style="text-align: justify;">This is the longest Hindu festival in Nepal, traditionally celebrated for two weeks with prayers and offerings to Durga, the Universal Mother Goddess. The great harvest festival of Nepal, Dashain is a time for family reunions, exchange of gifts and blessings, and elaborate pujas. Dashain honors the Goddess Durga, who was created out of the shakti or energy of all the gods, armed with weapons from each of them.Goddess Durga, symbolizing valor and prowess, is worshipped and offered sacrifices to ensure the devotees' progress and prosperity. During the first ten days, pilgrims flock to various river confluences early in the morning and sacred shrines in the evening. Ghatasthapana, Phool Pati, Mahaastami, Nawami and Vijaya Dashami are the series of the events under Dashain each marked with a different set of rituals.</p>

							<h3 class="text-center" style="text-decoration: underline;" >Origin</h2>
				<p class="margin-30" style="text-align: justify;">It is believed that the <span style="font-style:italic";>Dasain symbolizes the victory of the justice over evil. Once upon a time, the Goddess Durga with ten different manifestations dressed in the red robe, rode the tiger and armed herself with magic weapons to combat with the demon Mahishasura. After fighting for nine days and nights, Goddess Durgar finally killed the devil and saved the whole country. To commemorate the courageous Durgar, the king of Nepal respected her as “the sacred protector”. Since then, offering the sacrifices to the Goddess has become one of the most popular festive rituals.</p>

					<h3 class="text-center" style="text-decoration: underline;" >Days in Dashain</h2>
				<p class="margin-30" style="text-align: justify;"> Ghatasthapana – the beginning of the Dashain. On this day, we fill a Kalash (Small Pot made of metal – copper) with holy water mixed with cow dung, barley seed, and maze seed. Then the Kalash is provided to the priest for the blessing of goddess Durga. After that, the Kalash is taken to place where there is a lot of sand and soil seeded with the grains. This whole ritual is carried out on the certain auspicious time determined by astrologers.

Ghatasthapana Pooja

Phulpati – is the major celebration occurring on the seventh day (Saptami) from the day of Ghatasthapana. On this day, it’s a tradition in Nepal to bring nine types of Phulpati into the room where Goddess Durga and the pile of sand was worshipped. Therefore, the seventh day of Vijaya Dashami is also called Phulpati in Nepal.

Myth reveals bringing Phulpati brings all the nine goddesses to your home. All nine plants represent the goddess and every goddess represents Health, Wealth and prosperity.  Entering Phulpati to home signifies entering health, wealth and prosperity in your home.

There is also a major event on this day, which is celebrated at the center of Kathmandu, Tundikhel where canon is fired for celebration. The Brahmins would carry royal Kalash, holy Jamara, banana stalks and sugar cane tied with red cloth from Gorkha to Kathmandu.

Maha Asthami – is the eight days of Dashain. This is the day when the fiercest of Goddess Durga manifest to the bloodthirsty Kali and is appeased through the sacrifice of buffaloes, goats, hens, and ducks in temples throughout the nation. Blood, symbolic for its fertility, is offered to the Goddesses. Appropriately enough, the night of this day is called Kal Ratri (Black Night). It is also the norm for buffaloes, goats to be sacrificed in the courtyards of all the land revenue offices in the country on this day.

Jamara and Kalash

Maha Navami – is the ninth day of Dashain. According to myth, this was the day when all the demons were slaughtered by goddess Durga. The ceremonies and rituals reach the peak on the ninth day of Dashain. On this day, God Vishvakarman – the god of creation is worshipped with the belief of making the things we used happy and prosperous. Most of the tools are worshipped by sacrificing and offering animals. The Taleju Temple gates are opened to the public on only this day of the year. Thousands of devotees go and pay respect to the goddess this day. The temple is filled with devotees all day long.

Bijaya Dashami – the tenth day of Dashain. On this day Tika – a mixture of yogurt, rice, and red color, which the elder stick on the forehead of young ones and provide them with a blessing to grow bigger and successful. Nepali and Hindus people from all around gather on this day to get Tika from their elder ones. On this day most of the family are united who have been far for long. This is one reason why the festival is celebrated with so much enthusiasm.
